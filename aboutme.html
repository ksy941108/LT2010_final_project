<p> <b> Hi, my name is Sang. I am a Senior majoring in computer science and graduating this semester.
   <br> After high school, I signed up for Military and spent 7 years in the service.
   <br> I had chances to go around the world, training in different countries, and learn different cultures.
   <br> I am excited to see what else I can experience and travel around the world
   <br> and working in different countries after graduating.
